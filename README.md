# Sleep Pattern and Spotify Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of the Sabancı University - DSA210 Introduction to Data Science course and investigates the relationship between music listening habits and sleep behavior by analyzing two datasets:

1. **Spotify Listening Data** (collected over a year)  
2. **Sleep Records** (spanning one year)

## Project Motivation

Being passionate about music and mindful of maintaining good sleep routines, I have often questioned whether there is a link between these two aspects of my lifestyle. This project aims to investigate whether my music listening habits—particularly during late-night hours—have an impact on my sleep quality or duration. By examining these datasets, I hope to discover meaningful patterns and connections that shed light on how these behaviors influence each other.

## Data Description
The analysis draws on two distinct datasets:

### Sleep Data
- **Timeframe:** Nightly records across one year.  
- **Key Attributes:**
  - Total sleep duration (in hours)
  - Sleep start and end times
  - Indicators of sleep quality (if available)


### Spotify Data
- **Timeframe:** A full year of data.  
- **Key Attributes:**
  - Songs listened to (titles and artists)
  - Listening duration
  - Timestamps of playback
  - Associated genres

## Goals and Next Steps

### 1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Perform a detailed exploration of Spotify data to identify listening habits, such as peak listening times and preferred genres.
   - Analyze sleep data to recognize trends, including consistent sleep durations and irregularities.

### 2. **Understanding Connections**
   - Investigate potential links between late-night music listening and sleep patterns, such as changes in duration or quality.
   - Explore whether specific genres or listening durations correlate with better or worse sleep outcomes.

### 3. **Modeling and Insights**
   - Develop machine learning models to predict sleep quality based on listening behavior.
   - Group similar patterns using clustering methods to identify common trends in music and sleep interactions.

### 4. **Reporting and Visualization**
   - Present findings through detailed visualizations and reports.
   - Provide actionable insights based on the analysis for improved understanding of personal habits.
