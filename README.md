The  DSA210 Project by Kerem Taşgın

# PROJECT IDEA

As most of the students have problems about finding enough time to sleeping, I have figure out that most the students who are at the 4th grade are having a reduction in their sleep time, because of the work and studies at the same time. This will analyze how the amount of time spent on screen effects their sleep time.
